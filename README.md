# SecretKnockLock
This repository contains the adruino code for our project Secret Knock Lock 
This Project was made using Adruino Mega 
The concept of this project was to Create a system that would unlock a door based on a secret knock pattern entered by the user
If the user forgets or looses his keys he/she will will still be able to unlock and enter his room without wasting money and time by calling a locksmith
Also the user can give this Secret Knock to whomever he/she wants so that the user doesnt have to attend the door everytime their close friends come by.
This is our first prototype and various other security features will be added after a short interval of development and research time that connects various features of IoT with the project
Thank u
